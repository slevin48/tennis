To do this for Roland Garros, I need a list of players still in the tournament â€” probably using the top 1-32 seeds. To speed things up, I could rely on a pre-defined list of players. The simplest approach is to predict the winner by identifying the player with the highest clay Elo rating. I'll compute the top 20 players by this rating and simulate the tournament."

I'll gather a list of top players, possibly using the seed rankings or current Elo ratings to approximate. The simplest approach is to simulate the tournament and pick the player with the highest clay surface Elo.

Random Forest could help with this, as it focuses on differences in ratings. We can create a Monte Carlo simulation, but tracking a bracket structure would be more accurate. For simplicity, Iâ€™ll use the Random Forest model to calculate each player's chance of winning by averaging their win probability against competitors, then raise it to the 7th power for a championship."
