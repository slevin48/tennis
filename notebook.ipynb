    "Let's simulate the tournament champion prediction based on model outputs. We can compute each player's probability of winning by evaluating their Elo and predicted match outcomes. Random Forest could help with this, as it focuses on differences in ratings. We can create a Monte Carlo simulation, but tracking a bracket structure would be more accurate. For simplicity, Iâ€™ll use the Random Forest model to calculate each player's chance of winning by averaging their win probability against competitors, then raise it to the 7th power for a championship."
